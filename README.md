# Pokedex
This is an application that allows the user to use a Pokedex from pokemon. The user is able to open up the pokedex and scroll through all 151 original pokemon. The user is able to select the pokemon that he or she wants to know more about and open up the data concerning that pokemon. 

The libraries used are:

adapter

binding

details

di

fragments

initializer

mapper

model

network

persitence

repository

ui

utils



I used the pokedex design from the orignal - colored - game remake to make it more relatable. 
I would like to scale this application to include all of the pokemon released, not just the original 151.
